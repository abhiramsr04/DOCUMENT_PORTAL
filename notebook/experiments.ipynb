       "\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, let's see. I remember from school that France is a country in Europe, right? And capitals are usually big cities. I think Paris is the capital. Wait, isn't Paris known for the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre? Yeah, that sounds familiar. But wait, maybe it's another city like Lyon or Marseille? No, Lyon is a major city, but I think Paris is more prominent. Let me try to recall if there's any other city that could be the capital. Maybe Strasbourg? No, Strasbourg is in the Alsace region, and I think the European Parliament is there, but that's not the capital of France. What about Bordeaux? No, that's more of a wine region. Oh, right, the capital of France is definitely Paris. But just to be sure, isn't Paris the political and administrative center? Yeah, that's right. I think the government is based there. So, yeah, the answer should be Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. It serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. Notable landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral are located in Paris, further cementing its status as a world-renowned city. \\n\\n**Answer:** Paris.\""
